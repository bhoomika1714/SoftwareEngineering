### **1. Layered Architecture**
**Non-functional requirements it focuses on**:
- **Maintainability**: The separation of concerns between layers allows independent updates and changes.
- **Scalability**: Logical separation enables scaling of individual layers (e.g., a load balancer on the presentation layer).
- **Reusability**: Common functionalities in lower layers (e.g., data access) can be reused by multiple upper layers.
- **Testability**: Layers can be tested in isolation.

**Best for**:
- Applications requiring a strict hierarchy (e.g., web apps, enterprise systems).

---

### **2. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture**
**Non-functional requirements it focuses on**:
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns (Model, View, Controller) simplifies changes.
- **Testability**: Independent testing of models, controllers, and views.
- **Flexibility**: The view and controller can be modified without affecting business logic.
- **User Experience**: Designed to support dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

**Best for**:
- Web applications or systems with high UI interaction (e.g., dashboards, SPAs).

---

### **3. Pipe-Filter Architecture**
**Non-functional requirements it focuses on**:
- **Reusability**: Filters (individual processing units) can be reused in different configurations.
- **Scalability**: Filters can run in parallel or be distributed across systems.
- **Modularity**: Each filter performs a distinct function, simplifying maintenance.
- **Performance**: Data flows efficiently through pipelines, with potential for parallel processing.

**Best for**:
- Data processing pipelines (e.g., ETL processes, multimedia processing).

---

### **4. Repository Architecture**
**Non-functional requirements it focuses on**:
- **Data Integrity**: A centralized repository ensures consistency and correctness.
- **Scalability**: Repository access can be optimized with caching or load balancers.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to data schemas or repository logic impact the whole system minimally.
- **Concurrency**: Centralized control enables managing concurrent access.

**Best for**:
- Systems needing centralized data storage (e.g., content management systems, version control).

---

### **5. Client-Server Architecture**
**Non-functional requirements it focuses on**:
- **Scalability**: Multiple clients can interact with a single server or distributed servers.
- **Availability**: Servers can be replicated for redundancy to ensure high availability.
- **Security**: Centralized control simplifies managing access and permissions.
- **Platform Independence**: Clients and servers can operate on different platforms.

**Best for**:
- Distributed systems (e.g., web apps, file-sharing platforms).

---

### **6. Event-Driven Architecture**
**Non-functional requirements it focuses on**:
- **Responsiveness**: Real-time or near-real-time updates.
- **Scalability**: Event-driven systems can handle high loads asynchronously.
- **Flexibility**: Loose coupling allows easy addition of new event producers/consumers.
- **Reliability**: Event queues or brokers ensure events are not lost.

**Best for**:
- Real-time systems (e.g., IoT, messaging systems).

---

### **7. Microservices Architecture**
**Non-functional requirements it focuses on**:
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failures are isolated to individual services.
- **Deployability**: Independent deployment of services minimizes downtime.
- **Flexibility**: Teams can work on different services using different technologies.

**Best for**:
- Large-scale, distributed systems with evolving business requirements.

---

### **8. Peer-to-Peer Architecture**
**Non-functional requirements it focuses on**:
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure.
- **Scalability**: Each peer contributes resources to the system.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system continues to function despite the failure of individual nodes.
- **Performance**: Direct peer-to-peer communication can reduce latency.

**Best for**:
- File-sharing networks, blockchain systems.
