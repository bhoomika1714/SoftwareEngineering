**3. Why Test-First Development Helps Programmers Understand System Requirements and Its Potential Difficulties**  
- **Benefits:** Test-first development, part of Test-Driven Development (TDD), encourages programmers to define clear requirements by writing tests before code. This process forces developers to focus on system functionality and helps them understand requirements deeply since tests must align with expected system behaviors.
- **Difficulties:** Challenges include the need for discipline to write tests before coding, especially when requirements are complex or unclear. It can also be challenging when working with rapidly evolving requirements, as tests may need constant updates.

**4. Principles of Agile Methods**  
1. **Customer Involvement:** Frequent interaction with the customer ensures requirements are accurately understood and met.
2. **Incremental Delivery:** Software is delivered in small, functional increments, allowing early and continuous feedback.
3. **People Over Process:** Agile emphasizes skilled team members and effective communication over strict processes and tools.
4. **Embrace Change:** Agile methods welcome changing requirements even late in development, enabling adaptation to evolving needs.
5. **Maintain Simplicity:** Simplicity in design and development helps focus on only what is necessary, reducing unnecessary complexity.

**5. Differences Between Plan-Driven and Agile Methods of Software Development**  
- **Plan-Driven Methods:**  
  - Emphasize comprehensive upfront planning, detailed documentation, and strict adherence to project plans.
  - Best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes.
  - Development phases are typically linear, with a clear start-to-finish structure.
  
- **Agile Methods:**  
  - Focus on iterative, incremental development with adaptive planning and continuous feedback.
  - Effective for projects with evolving requirements and customer involvement.
  - Development is flexible and cyclical, allowing ongoing refinement and adjustments.

**6. Extreme Programming (XP) Practices**  
1. **Pair Programming:** Two developers work together on the same code, improving quality through collaboration.
2. **Test-First Development:** Tests are written before code to clarify requirements and improve quality.
3. **Continuous Integration:** Code is frequently integrated and tested, ensuring early detection of issues.
4. **Refactoring:** Regular code improvements keep the design clean and efficient.
5. **Simple Design:** Emphasizes the simplest design that works for current requirements.
6. **Collective Code Ownership:** Code is owned by the team, allowing anyone to contribute and improve it.
7. **Sustainable Pace:** Maintains a steady, manageable work pace to avoid burnout.
8. **Customer Involvement:** Customers are actively involved, providing feedback and clarifying requirements regularly.

**Q1(c). Explain how the principles underlying agile methods lead to the accelerated development  and deployment of software.**
<br>
• **Customer Collaboration:** Agile emphasizes close collaboration with customers 
throughout the project, ensuring that the team is always working on the most important 
features. 
• **Incremental Development:** By delivering small, functional increments frequently, teams 
can quickly release usable software and gather feedback for future iterations. 
• **Flexibility:** Agile allows teams to respond to changes in requirements, which reduces the 
chances of delays caused by evolving customer needs. 
• **Continuous Feedback:** Frequent feedback from customers and stakeholders helps in 
refining the product early and often, reducing rework and accelerating deployment.
