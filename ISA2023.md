### **Q1.a | Process Model Selection for Software Projects | 08 Marks**

#### i) PhonePe - Digital Payment App
**Proposed Process Model:** **Agile Model**

1. **Rapidly Changing Requirements**: Digital payment apps like PhonePe must adapt quickly to changes due to market demands, security updates, and regulatory requirements. Agile is suited as it accommodates frequent changes.
   
2. **User-Centric Development**: Agile allows iterative improvements based on user feedback, essential for enhancing the user experience, adding features, and addressing security requirements continuously.

**Justification:** The Agile model’s adaptability and iterative approach are ideal for the dynamic nature of the digital payments industry, focusing on incremental updates and customer satisfaction.

#### ii) FASTag - Electronic Highway Toll Collection System
**Proposed Process Model:** **V-Model**

1. **Strict Compliance Requirements**: Toll collection systems like FASTag require rigorous compliance with government regulations, making the V-Model suitable due to its focus on verification and validation at each stage.
   
2. **Fixed and Clear Requirements**: Since toll collection systems have clear and relatively stable requirements, the V-Model works effectively, ensuring a structured testing phase that meets the predefined requirements.

**Justification:** The V-Model provides a clear structure for projects with fixed requirements, ensuring high-quality deliverables, making it an ideal choice for FASTag.

### **Q1.c | Agile Software Development Principles with Respect to Agile Manifesto | 04 Marks**

Agile Software Development is guided by principles outlined in the **Agile Manifesto**:

1. **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**: Agile emphasizes direct engagement with the customer to ensure alignment with their requirements, fostering feedback-based development.
   
2. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**: Agile values adaptability, focusing on delivering features in iterations that can be modified based on feedback, rather than rigidly following an initial plan.

3. **Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**: Agile prioritizes delivering functional software in short cycles, ensuring value to the user quickly without extensive pre-documentation.

4. **Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**: Agile focuses on enhancing team collaboration, as effective communication among team members is crucial for timely project completion and quality output.

### **Q2.a | Importance of Test-Driven Development in Extreme Programming (XP) | 08 Marks**

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is essential in **Extreme Programming (XP)** due to its focus on writing tests before developing code, ensuring that each feature meets its specifications from the start.

1. **Example**: In a shopping cart application, writing a test first for “Add Item” ensures that this function works as expected and passes all cases before implementation proceeds further. This prevents bugs, reduces debugging time, and maintains code quality throughout the lifecycle.

2. **Justification**: TDD emphasizes continuous feedback and short development cycles, where each piece of code is validated immediately. This minimizes future issues, aligns with XP’s quality-first philosophy, and facilitates refactoring without fear of breaking functionality.

### **Q2.b | Necessity of Requirement Discovery Techniques in Software Development | 08 Marks**

1. **Interviews**: Allows direct interaction with stakeholders to gain insights into expectations and specific needs, making it easier to align requirements with user needs.

2. **Questionnaires and Surveys**: Useful for gathering information from a large user base, especially for understanding common user preferences and essential features.

3. **Prototyping**: Creating a preliminary version helps in visualizing the software’s functionality, providing early feedback, and refining requirements based on user interaction.

4. **Observation**: Observing end-users in their natural environment helps to capture requirements they may not explicitly mention but are crucial for enhancing the software's usability.

Each technique provides unique insights, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the requirements and ensuring the final software meets user expectations.

### **Q2.c | Four Extreme Programming (XP) Practices with Life Cycle | 04 Marks**

1. **Pair Programming**: Developers work in pairs, one writing code while the other reviews it in real-time. This practice improves code quality and knowledge sharing.

2. **Continuous Integration**: Frequent integration of code into a shared repository ensures that changes are tested and merged without issues, maintaining a stable system.

3. **Refactoring**: Regularly improving code without altering functionality ensures clean, maintainable code, promoting adaptability for future updates.

4. **On-site Customer**: Keeping a customer representative available for feedback helps align the product with user needs, allowing quick adjustments in case of changing requirements.

### **Q3.a | KLE JGMM Medical College Patient Automation Software Using Waterfall Model and Incremental Model | 10 Marks**

#### Modules: Patients, Admission, Tests, Payment

##### i) Waterfall Model:
   - **Pros**:
     1. Clear structure with defined stages, making it easier to manage.
     2. Detailed documentation ensures all requirements are understood before development.

   - **Cons**:
     1. Limited flexibility, as any change requires restarting the whole process.
     2. Risk of missing essential features if requirements change after initiation.

##### ii) Incremental Model:
   - **Pros**:
     1. Allows for gradual development and testing of each module.
     2. Can adapt to new requirements in subsequent increments without restarting the project.

   - **Cons**:
     1. Requires good planning to manage multiple releases.
     2. Increased resource requirements for managing multiple testing cycles.

**Representation**: Each module would go through its own cycle in the **Incremental Model**, allowing functional software with each increment, while the **Waterfall Model** would follow a single linear flow.
