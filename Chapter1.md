## 3. Giving reasons for your answer based on the type of system being  developed, suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that  might be used to manage the development of the following systems.



---

### i. A System to Control Anti-lock Braking in a Car
**Suggested Model:** **Waterfall Model**  
**Reason:** Anti-lock braking systems are critical for safety, so they need a step-by-step development process. In the Waterfall Model, each step—like gathering requirements, design, and testing—is fully completed before moving to the next. This structured approach helps catch and fix issues early, ensuring the system is as reliable as possible.

### ii. A Virtual Reality System to Support Software Maintenance
**Suggested Model:** **Incremental Development**  
**Reason:** Virtual reality systems often need to be adjusted based on user feedback. The Incremental Model allows developers to build and test small parts of the system in stages, adding new features each time. This way, they can get feedback on each version, making it easier to improve the system step by step.

### iii. A University Accounting System That Replaces an Existing System
**Suggested Model:** **Integration and Configuration**  
**Reason:** Since this system will replace an older one, it makes sense to reuse existing components, like financial tools or database parts. With the Integration and Configuration approach, developers can focus on fitting together these existing parts. This saves time and money and makes it easier to switch from the old system to the new one without big issues.

### iv. An Interactive Travel Planning System to Help Users Plan Journeys with the Lowest Environmental Impact
**Suggested Model:** **Incremental Development**  
**Reason:** For a travel planning system, user needs may change often, like adding new routes or environmental options. The Incremental Model lets developers add new features in stages, so they can adjust the system based on user feedback. This makes it easier to keep the system up-to-date and user-friendly.

### Define Software Engineering. Write two reasons why it is important. 


> **“An engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production, from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use.”**

### Importance of Software Engineering:

1. **Ensures Reliability and Quality**  
   Software engineering applies structured, systematic approaches to designing, developing, and testing software. This helps in creating high-quality software that meets users' needs, functions reliably, and minimizes errors or failures. Quality and reliability are critical, especially for systems where errors can lead to significant harm or losses.

2. **Improves Development Efficiency and Reduces Costs**  
   By using established engineering principles, software engineering makes the development process more efficient, helping teams deliver projects on time and within budget. This efficiency reduces overall costs and enables organizations to allocate resources more effectively across projects.
