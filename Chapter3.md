### 1. Structure of SRS (Software Requirements Specification)  
The **SRS (Software Requirements Specification)** document is organized in a structured way to capture all requirements clearly. The structure typically includes the following:

   - **Introduction**: Describes the purpose of the system, its scope, and important definitions.
   - **Overall Description**: Gives a general view of the product, including its functions, constraints, assumptions, and dependencies.
   - **Functional Requirements**: Lists the main functions of the system that it needs to perform.
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Specifies system qualities such as performance, security, and usability.
   - **System Features**: Detailed descriptions of each feature and the related functionality.
   - **External Interface Requirements**: Explains how the system will interact with other systems, hardware, and users.
   - **Other Requirements**: Any specific requirements that don’t fall into the above categories, like legal or regulatory needs.

### 2. Use Cases of a Satellite Road Detection System  

Five use cases for a satellite road detection system include:

   - **Road Condition Detection**: Identifies the condition of roads (e.g., potholes, cracks) for maintenance alerts.
   - **Traffic Density Monitoring**: Monitors traffic levels to provide real-time traffic updates.
   - **Accident Detection**: Identifies and reports accidents to emergency services.
   - **Weather Impact Analysis**: Detects weather changes affecting road conditions, such as flooding or landslides.
   - **Road Usage Analysis**: Tracks how often certain roads are used, helping authorities plan infrastructure projects.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements Metrics for “Speed of Transaction” in UPI Payment App  

Two important metrics for specifying the speed of a transaction are:

   - **Response Time**: Measures the time it takes for the app to respond after the user initiates a payment. This includes the processing time for verifying user details, checking balance, and confirming the transaction.
   - **Throughput**: Represents the number of transactions processed per second. A higher throughput indicates that the system can handle many transactions simultaneously without delay.

### 4. Important Components of SRS  

The **important components of an SRS** document are as follows:

   - **Introduction**: States the system’s purpose, scope, and any background information needed.
   - **Overall Description**: Provides an overview of the system's main functionality and objectives.
   - **Functional Requirements**: Lists what the system must do, describing every feature.
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Defines system qualities like reliability, security, and performance.
   - **External Interface Requirements**: Describes how the system will communicate with other systems, devices, or users.
   - **System Features**: Explains each function in detail, linking them to the corresponding requirements.
   - **Constraints**: Lists any limitations or restrictions on the system, such as regulatory requirements or hardware limitations.

### 5. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements for a Toll Collection System  

#### Functional Requirements:
1. **Toll Collection at Multiple Entry Points**: The system must collect tolls at all state highway entry points.
2. **Vehicle Identification**: The system should identify each vehicle passing through, either via license plate or RFID.
3. **Payment Processing**: It must support different payment modes (e.g., cash, card, UPI).
4. **Receipt Generation**: The system should provide a printed or digital receipt for each transaction.
5. **Data Analysis for Reports**: The system should analyze data to produce reports on toll collection, vehicle frequency, and peak traffic times.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Performance**: The system must process toll transactions within 2 seconds to avoid traffic build-up.
2. **Scalability**: It should handle an increasing number of transactions as traffic grows without performance issues.

### 6. Use Case Diagram for WhatsApp and Description of One Use Case  

#### Use Case Diagram for WhatsApp  

The diagram includes two main actors, **User** and **Server**, with the following use cases:

- **Login**
- **Send Message**
- **Receive Message**
- **Make Call**
- **Update Status**

**Diagram Representation**:

[User] -- (Login)  
[User] -- (Send Message)  
[User] -- (Receive Message)  
[User] -- (Make Call)  
[User] -- (Update Status)  
[Server] -- (Manage Messages)

#### Use Case Description for "Send Message"  

- **Use Case Name**: Send Message  
- **Actor**: User  
- **Description**: Allows a user to send a text message to another contact.  
- **Preconditions**: User must be logged in and connected to the internet.  
- **Basic Flow**:  
  1. User types a message in the chat box.
  2. User presses "Send."
  3. The message is sent to the server.
  4. The server forwards the message to the recipient.
  5. The recipient receives and reads the message.

- **Postconditions**: Message is sent and stored in the chat history for both sender and receiver.  
- **Alternate Flow**: If there is no internet connection, the message is saved and sent once the connection is restored.
