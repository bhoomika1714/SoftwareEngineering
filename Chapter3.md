### 1. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

   - **Functional Requirements**: These define specific functions or tasks the system must perform. They are direct actions that the software must support, often described as "what the system should do." Functional requirements are tied to user needs and dictate system behavior.
     - *Examples*: For a banking app, functional requirements include checking balances, transferring money, and generating statements.

   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: These describe qualities or constraints on the system rather than specific functions. They often focus on "how the system should perform" rather than "what it should do."
     - *Types of Non-Functional Requirements*:
       - **Performance**: How quickly should the system respond? (e.g., transaction processing time in a bank app).
       - **Reliability**: System stability and fault tolerance (e.g., should run 24/7 without failure).
       - **Usability**: How user-friendly is the interface?
       - **Security**: Protection against unauthorized access.
       - **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing loads or expanding user bases.
     - *Examples*: For a banking app, a non-functional requirement would be “system availability 99.9% of the time.”

### 2. Requirements Engineering Processes

The **Requirements Engineering Process** is a series of structured steps to understand, document, and manage system requirements. This process ensures the requirements are clear, consistent, and aligned with user needs. The process includes four key steps:

   - **Requirements Elicitation**: Gathering information from stakeholders, users, and other sources to understand what is needed.
   - **Requirements Specification**: Documenting the requirements clearly and in detail.
   - **Requirements Validation**: Ensuring requirements accurately reflect user needs.
   - **Requirements Management**: Ongoing monitoring and updating of requirements as they evolve.

These processes are typically iterative, meaning they’re repeated as new requirements emerge or existing ones change.

### 3. Requirements Elicitation

**Requirements Elicitation** involves techniques to gather detailed information about what the system should do from stakeholders (end-users, clients, etc.). It’s a crucial part of understanding user expectations and defining accurate requirements.

   - **Techniques for Requirements Elicitation**:
     - **Interviews**: One-on-one conversations with users or stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
     - **Surveys and Questionnaires**: Collect data from a large number of users at once.
     - **Workshops**: Interactive group sessions where multiple stakeholders discuss requirements.
     - **Observation**: Watching users perform tasks to understand how the system can support them.
     - **Prototyping**: Creating a basic version of the system to help users visualize features and give feedback.

   - **Challenges in Requirements Elicitation**:
     - **Communication Gaps**: Users may not clearly communicate what they need.
     - **Changing Requirements**: User needs often evolve, causing requirements to change.
     - **Conflicting Requirements**: Different users or stakeholders may have contradictory needs.

---

### 4. Requirements Specification

The **Requirements Specification** stage involves documenting the gathered requirements in a structured and detailed way. The goal is to create a comprehensive reference document for developers, testers, and stakeholders.

   - **Structure of an SRS Document**: The SRS (Software Requirements Specification) usually includes:
     - **Introduction**: Describes the purpose and scope of the system.
     - **Overall Description**: A general overview of the product's goals and main functions.
     - **Functional Requirements**: Detailed description of each function the system must perform.
     - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Details on performance, security, usability, and other constraints.
     - **System Interfaces**: Describes how the system will interact with other systems or users.
   
   - **Importance of Clear Specification**:
     - Ensures everyone has a shared understanding of what the system will do.
     - Helps to prevent misunderstandings or ambiguity during development.
     - Serves as a reference throughout development, testing, and maintenance.

---

### 5. Requirements Validation

**Requirements Validation** is the process of checking that the documented requirements accurately represent the stakeholders' needs and are complete and feasible. This stage helps ensure the requirements will lead to a system that meets user expectations and works as intended.

   - **Methods for Requirements Validation**:
     - **Requirements Review**: Stakeholders and developers review the requirements together.
     - **Prototyping**: A basic model of the system is created to test requirements.
     - **Test Case Generation**: Creating test cases based on requirements to check if they cover all functional needs.
     - **Consistency and Completeness Check**: Verifying that requirements don’t conflict with each other and are all covered.

   - **Importance of Validation**:
     - Prevents costly changes by identifying issues early.
     - Confirms that the development team has an accurate understanding of the user's needs.
     - Ensures that requirements are feasible within the technical and budget constraints.
