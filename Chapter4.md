- User interaction modeling is important as it helps to identify user requirements. 
- Modeling system-to-system interaction highlights the communication problems that 
may arise.
- Modeling component interaction helps us understand if a proposed system 
structure is likely to deliver the required system performance and dependability.

 -  Use case modeling, which is mostly used to model interactions between a sys
tem and external agents (human users or other systems).
 -  Sequence diagrams, which are used to model interactions between system com
ponents, although external agents may also be included
