- User interaction modeling is important as it helps to identify user requirements. 
- Modeling system-to-system interaction highlights the communication problems that 
may arise.
- Modeling component interaction helps us understand if a proposed system 
structure is likely to deliver the required system performance and dependability.

 -  Use case modeling, which is mostly used to model interactions between a sys
tem and external agents (human users or other systems).
 -  Sequence diagrams, which are used to model interactions between system com
ponents, although external agents may also be included
## INTERACTION MODELS :
- Modeling user interaction is important as it helps 
to identify user requirements. 
- Modeling system-to-system interaction highlights 
the communication problems that may arise. 
-  Modeling component interaction helps us 
understand if a proposed system structure is 
likely to deliver the required system performance 
and dependability. 
  -  se case diagrams and sequence diagrams may 
be used for interaction modeling.

## USE CASE MODELING :
- Use cases were developed originally to support 
requirements elicitation and now incorporated 
into the UML.
 - Each use case represents a discrete task that 
involves external interaction with a system.
 - Actors in a use case may be people or other 
systems.
- Represented diagramatically to provide an 
overview of the use case and in a more detailed 
textual form.
